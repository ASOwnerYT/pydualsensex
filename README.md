# pydualsensex
A [DualSenseX](https://github.com/Paliverse/DualSenseX/) alternative made with [pydualsense](https://github.com/flok/pydualsense/). Currently very experimental and only supports a few adaptive trigger effects.

For now this only works for BeamNG.drive using this mod: https://www.beamng.com/resources/dsx-dualsense-adaptive-triggers.28759/

# Usage
1. Install Python
2. Install [pydualsense](https://github.com/flok/pydualsense/#installation)
3. Make sure to install a DSX mod for your game. Steam Input or similar software may also be required if the game doesn't support Dualsense PS5 controllers
4. Run main.py to start the UDP server
5. Enjoy
